```

## Detection
```md
This incident was detected when the HTTPS Non 200 Alert was triggered and just James was paged.

Next, nobody was paged, because James didn't have anybody else.

James will work on getting a new pizza factory since this was can apparently be triggered to not return pizzas.
```

## Impact

```md
For approximately 10 minutes between {11:54 Mountain Time and 12:04 Mountain Time} on 04/08/2025, 10 of our users experienced this incident.

```

## Response

After receiving a page at {06:01 UTC}, James came online at {06:03 UTC} in Grafana.

This engineer did not have a background in the Pizza Factory, but he had eaten pizza before. He clicked on a random link that came in with the alert and magically resolved it.

One of the original developers in the pizza service had malicious intent and created a bug that caused the pizza factory to not return pizzas.
```

By clicking the random link, James resolved the issue. A new service and pizza factory will be provisioned to prevent further malicious attacks.
```

```md
No other issues have occurred since the incident or before it. Still possible to happen, will be monitored.

1. Build a new pizza factory to remove all dependencies on the old one.

```
